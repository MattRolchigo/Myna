# Installation

The `classification` library is available on the internal
ORNL Gitlab at https://code.ornl.gov/ygk/classification.

The library can be installed locally with `pip install .`.
There can be an issue with installing the `bnpy` dependency
on certain versions of Python. The `bnpy` installation has been
successfully tested on Python 3.8.10.
